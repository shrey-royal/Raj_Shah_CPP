OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System): It is a paradigm that provides many concepts such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism etc.

> OOPs is a paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
> Using these concepts we can solve any real world Problem.
> CPP/C++ is a semi object oriented programming system.

> It consists of 4 pillars: 
    1. Inheritance
    2. Polymorphism
    3. Abstraction
    4. Encapsulation

ALl the topics needs a basic understanding of Objects and Classes

Q What are Objects?
> Any entity that has state and behaviour is known as an object.
> Object means a real world entity such as pen, chair, table, jet, bike, etc.
> Objects can be logical as well as physical entity.

Q What are Classes?
> Collection of Objects is called a class. it is a logical entity.
> A Object's class acts as its blueprint


Examples of Objects:
(object) - (class)

1. Car - Vehicle
2. Smartphone - Electronic Device
3. Dog - Animal
4. Plane -  Aircraft
5. Laptop - Computer
6. Orange - Fruit

syntax of class: 

class class_name {
    access_modifiers:
    //variable / instance variables / data members / class members
    
    //methods
};

for ex:
class Student {
    //
};

syntax of Object: 

class_name obj_name;

for ex:
Student obj;


Access Modifiers: Lets you control the access to the class Members for the objects

public          : accessible everywhere.
private(default): accessible within the class.
protected       : accessible within the class as well as in the derived classes.
